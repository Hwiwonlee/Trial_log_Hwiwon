Welcome. My name is Hwiwon Lee. I'm interested in statistics and machine learning, enjoying data analysis that makes valuable discoveries in chaotic data. My main language is R and I am studying for analysis using Python.

방문해주셔서 감사합니다. 제 이름은 이휘원입니다. 무질서한 데이터에서 가치 있는 발견을 해내는 데이터 분석을 즐기며 통계학과 머신러닝에 흥미가 있어 공부하고 있습니다. 주로 사용하는 언어는 R이며 Python을 활용한 분석을 위해 공부 중입니다.
